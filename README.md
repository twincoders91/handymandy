# Project Title
HandyMandy is a full stack application for on demand handyman services. Think of it like grab but for handyman services.

# Project Description:
HandyMandy app provides users with on-demand handyman services via a web/mobile app, by connecting the 2 main types of accounts, a general user and a handyman user. HandyMandy has an in-app instant messaging feature that allows simple communication between users and handymans. In a summarised format, handyman users create services which will be displayed on the application. Users can view and select services that appeal to them, the app then creates a job request. Handyman users can choose to accept job requests which will be converted into jobs. Once a job is completed, users can provide constructive reviews which will be displayed on the handyman's profile.
